RAD-VAN dregis
This is a private docker registry and a caching proxy to the Nexus servers in Tel Aviv.

If you see this page, it is alive!

If your docker daemons have never used this registry/proxy before, get the self-signed certificate here and follow this link to make your docker daemons to accept the certificate.

If you are running docker on Linux machines (Ubuntu 18.04 or later), run these commands:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/dregis
wget --no-check-certificate -O- https://dregis.strangeloop.net/ca.crt | \
  sudo tee /etc/docker/certs.d/dregis/ca.crt
